Shapiro
=======

**Shapiro is a library** of functions for writing concise code.

**Shapiro is for GIS** (geographic information systems) and related domains, including
data analysis and numerical modelling (mostly pre- and post-processing).

**Shapiro is 100% organic**: it grows as I am charged with or otherwise become interested in particular computational tasks.

Forthcoming: Suggested configurations.

Organization
------------

Shapiro is, at the highest level, organized into several repositories according to the
[storage discipline](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/repos/blob/main/Files/CORW/0/conventions.md#storageDiscipline)
applied to file and directory maintenance:

 - [WORM / main](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro) (a.k.a., _Shapiro_)
 - [CORA](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro-CORA) (_Shapiro-CORA_)
 - [CORW](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro-CORW) (_Shapiro-CORW_)
 - [DYNA](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro-DYNA) (_Shapiro-DYNA_)
 
The organization is intended to support reliability and
[reproducibility](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25303/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science).

Updates
-------

**Shapiro changes by the addition** of new files,
_not_ by breaking code and mutilating existing files.
The foregoing applies to R files only.
Documentation (typically in "md" files), for example, may be revised.

Updates of non-R files originally created at
[Shapiro](
https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro
) (WORM)
are discussed under
[Emigration](
./worm.emigration.md
).

Versions
--------

**Shapiro does not have "versions."**
Components either exist or not.
You may use them in any combination.
You may use the advanced features of R to reinterpret them in ways I have not anticipated.
Version control is for teams that think they are developing _one_ thing.
But Shapiro is about creating thousands of little tools,
facilitating billions and billions of combinations of those tools.
