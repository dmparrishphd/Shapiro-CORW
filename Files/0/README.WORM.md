Shapiro
=======

**Shapiro is a library** of functions for writing concise code.

**Shapiro is for GIS** (geographic information systems) and related domains, including
data analysis and numerical modelling (mostly pre- and post-processing).

**Shapiro is 100% organic**: it grows as I am charged with or otherwise become interested in particular computational tasks.

Forthcoming: Suggested configurations.

Organization
------------

Shapiro is organized into several repositories.
The "Shapiro" [reposiory](https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro)
is (as of 2021-05-10) a
[write once, read many times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write_once_read_many)
repository.

The organization is intended to support reliability and
[reproducibility](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25303/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science).

The highest level of organization is according to the policy and
intended discipline of the corresponding components:

 - [Shapiro](
https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro
) (WORM) _write once, read many times_

 - [Shapiro-CORA](
https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro-CORA
) _create once, read and append many times_

 - [Shapiro-CORW](
https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro-CORW
) _create once, read and write many times_

 - [Shapiro-DYNA](
https://github.com/dmparrishphd/Shapiro-DYNA
) _dynamic / volatile_

Updates
-------

**Shapiro changes by the addition** of new files,
_not_ by breaking code and mutilating existing files.

Versions
--------

**Shapiro does not have "versions."**
Components either exist or not.
You may use them in any combination.
You may use the advanced features of R to reinterpret them in ways I have not anticipated.
Version control is for teams that think they are developing _one_ thing.
But Shapiro is about creating thousands of little tools,
facilitating billions and billions of combinations of those tools.
